Small Game 1
============

A small game release.

Project goal: limit the scope of the project as much as possible,
creating a simple game that is minimalist in terms setup, dependencies, art, and gameplay.
The finished product should function and be available online.

This is a web based project using the HTML5 Canvas API and vanilla JavaScript.
