Small Game 1
============

Work in Progress.

A small game release.
This is a web based project using the HTML5 Canvas API and vanilla JavaScript.

Project goal: limit the scope of the project as much as possible,
creating a simple game that is minimalist in terms setup, dependencies, art, and gameplay.
The finished product should function and be available online.

Disclaimer: This project is meant for educational purposes, not to actually be a fun game.

Only expected to run in modern browsers that have good feature support, specifically Chrome and Firefox.
