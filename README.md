HTML5 Canvas Game Demo
======================

A small game I made to experiment with Canvas and brush up on game programming.

Supports Chrome and Firefox.

User feedback notes:

* RFE: Start button
* RFE: Reset button
* IDEA: Leaderboard (probably won't do this, requires backend)
* BUG: Player cannot shoot while off screen (bullets immediately de-spawn)
* BUG: Right clicking causes player to move forever, possible issue with key handling
* BUG: Objects can spawn immediately next to player while the player is moving, UX issue/bug
